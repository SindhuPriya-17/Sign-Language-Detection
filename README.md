# Sign-Language-Detection
Real time sign language detection using tensorflow object detection api and python.


1) Firstly a dataset is collected and the useful information extracted is input into supervised learning techniques.
2) Computer recognition of sign language deals from sign gesture acquisition and continues till text generation.
3) The images are collected for learning using webcam and opencv. 
4) Then the images are labelled for sign language detection using labelimg. 
5) Next, a tensorflow object detection api is set up to train the deep learning model.
6) And finally the language is detected using opencv and webcam.  
   
   So ideally the result is a real-time object detection device that can detect different sign
language poses.
